## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer transaction-level data, including:
- Customer ID
- Order ID
- Purchase date
- Product / Category
- Quantity
- Price / Revenue

The data is used across **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI** to ensure consistency in analysis.

## 🧮 SQL Analysis
SQL is used to:
- Filter and clean raw data
- Perform joins across multiple tables
- Calculate total sales and revenue
- Identify top customers and products
- Generate aggregated metrics for analysis

Example insights:
- Total revenue by month
- Top 10 customers by revenue
- Category-wise sales performance

## 🐍 Python Analysis
Python is used for:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing or inconsistent values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Creating visualizations (bar charts, line charts)

Libraries used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Sales and revenue trends
- Customer segmentation visuals
- Top-performing products and categories
- Interactive filters (date, category, customer)
